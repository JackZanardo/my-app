# MyApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Details

This project is some practice I am doing with Angular.  It features a list of cheeses and the details of those cheeses, with the ability to modify the name and texture of the cheese.
